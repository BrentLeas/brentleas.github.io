I have been humbled and blessed to have had the opportunity to serve for the past 5 years as the elected representative member on the Bentonville Public Schools Board of Education, Zone D2. I have been honored to have witnessed & been a part of the growth of our district over these past 5 years.
<br>
<br>
Just to name a few achievements and accomplishments during my time on the Board of Education:
<br>
<br>
-Successful passage of a millage campaign in 2013 for the building of what would become Bentonville West High School.
<br>
<br>
-Collaborative partnership with the City of Bentonville Parks and Recreation to invest in a City Pool for our exclusive use for our High School Swim and Dives teams.
<br>
<br>
-The establishment and investment into the Ignite Professional Studies Center, allowing our High School students an avenue to engage in real, relevant, learning to develop the skills and habits of mind necessary for the innovation economy; all afforded with community partnerships with our valued corporate patrons in our district and beyond.  
Investment and expansion of our Gateway and Alternative Learning Programs, which has helped to increase our High School graduation rate; proving that we value and believe on all of our students & their success
<br>
<br>
-Successfully opened Fulbright Junior High School (2013), Bentonville West High School (2016), and opening this year (2017): Osage Creek Elementary & Creekside Middle Schools. 
<br>
<br>
-Funding for Osage Creek Elementary & Creekside Middle Schools was done without asking the voters for a millage increase.
<br>
<br>
-Successful passage of an additional millage May 2017 to fund future buildings and land for expected student population growth.
<br>
<br>  
-106 acres purchased in proximity to Southeastern Bella Vista for future building plans.
<br>
<br>
I look forward to continuing to serve and represent the constituents and patrons for Zone D2 in the Bentonville Public Schools District and continuing BUILDING EDUCATIONAL MOMENTUM!
