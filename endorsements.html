Brent is one of the finest Board members I have had the privilege of working with in my career.  He is always prepared, he is thoughtful, he understands school finance, and most importantly, he bases his decisions on the needs of children. During Brent’s tenure, some amazing accomplishments have taken place in Bentonville Schools.  Awards of performance at the local, state and national level are too numerous to name.  Several accomplishments that Brent and his fellow Board members should be honored for are having Bentonville named as the top school district in the State (NICHE), for improving the District’s graduation rate, for finding ways to deal with growth in a financially prudent way, and for building a top notch career tech program (Ignite).  I would be remiss if I did not state that Brent Leas really took the lead in helping develop Ignite.  He went on several trips to help better understand the model of delivery and helped encourage business leaders to collaborate on this new program. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Finally, I would share that Brent Leas really understands what good governance looks like.  He does his homework prior to meetings, he asks questions prior to meetings as well at Board meetings, and he bases his decisions on what is best for students.  Bentonville School District would be fortunate to have Brent Leas for another term on the school board.  If I lived in that Board zone I would have zero reservations in supporting this leader.”

               <div class="collapsible-body white"><span>“I have been honored to have served alongside Brent as a school board member during some of the most important decisions for the Bentonville School District over the last 5 years. 
                  Brent actively participated in numerous public forums to inform the community and the voters in Bella Vista of the overcrowding issue and how he would ensure that their tax dollars would be accounted for and spent wisely for their kids and families. He also diligently worked hard to ensure those voters that did not have school-aged children were represented equally in the process. Because of Brent’s efforts and his trustworthiness in representing the kids, parents and voters, Bella Vistans have shown strong support across the last two millage elections.
                  Brent understand the meaning of representation. He understands that being on the school board should be about providing the best education for the kids and families at the best value across the district. Brent represents all families and understands that different families have different needs. He is sensitive to different family situations, income levels, parent situations as well as Bentonville’s homeless student population. Brent understands that you elected him to make the best decisions on your behalf. He represents all the children and families regardless of income, status or influence. He understands that this role you have entrusted him with is to be earned everyday through hard work and consistency.
                  Brent is a servant leader. From working through thousands of hours over the last 5 years in developing the right millage structure for his voters to provide facilities for our overcrowded students to staying until 1:00 am working through issues in board meetings, Brent does what it takes to work hard and honor your trust in him.
                  Brent values children and families. He is very active dad not only with his three children but also with kids and families across the district. From his two BHS grads, Breanna and Josiah, to his daughter Sophia at Cooper Elementary, Brent understands the value of being present and active in the lives of students. When he makes decisions on the school board, he is always thinking about your kids, your family and his community.
                  Brent sacrifices for you. Being on the school board can be very fulfilling in service but it also requires great sacrifice. From the hours of meeting preparation, long committee and board meetings outside of his paying job to missed family time with his forgiving and loving wife, Stephanie, Brent and his family understand the cost for you.
                  Brent is a community leader. A good board member should be actively engaged throughout the community. Brent is actively involved in his church serving others across the community. His background in finance in working with individuals and business gives him great understanding into the challenges that the community faces. His service with the Benton County Rural Development Authority and Bentonville Rotary Club allows him the opportunity to serve others above himself.
                  Brent Leas has proven himself a strong, committed and trustworthy leader for your kids and families of the Bentonville School District and especially his neighbors in Bella Vista Zone 2! I highly recommend him to continue serving you and your kids and families for reelection!

                  Academics, Arts, and Athletics, and currently serve on the Bentonville School Foundation. Needless to
                  say, we have been very involved with the District over the last 22 years.
                  We have three sons that went thru the Bentonville Public School system. My family is blessed to have
                  had the opportunities that were enjoyed due to the Bentonville Education system. Academically the
                  boys were prepared for College two graduated from UCA in Conway and one from Ouachita Baptist in
                  Arkadelphia.
                  I believe that the public-school system is the backbone to a strong Community, Sate, and Nation. I feel
                  strongly that we need Men and Women that desire what is best for our student’s education to prepare
                  them for the future on our School Board. It is for this reason I proudly support Brent Leas for reelection
                  to the Bentonville School Board. Brent has proven he puts the education of students ahead of any
                  personal agenda. Brent Leas is a person that will serve the district and stand up for Students, Teachers,
                  and Administrators to provide the best education possible."

                  <br>
                  Brent, thank you for your many years of service and the willingness to continue serving.

Early voting is ongoing now and the polls will be open next Tuesday. I have known Brent since moving to Bentonville 4½ years ago as CEO and President of the Greater Bentonville Area Chamber of Commerce. I have had the opportunity to get to know him both in his role as a business leader in our communities and as a school board member. I actively worked with him in the two most recent school mileage elections and as a result saw his ability to meet needs and also to develop a strong vision to keep the Bentonville school district the #1 district in Arkansas. I have found Brent to be a person of high integrity, someone that listens to his constituents and, most importantly, has the best interest of kids and teachers in the district as his primary goal. It is for these reasons that I am honored to endorse Brent for reelection to the Bentonville school board. Please go vote…and vote for Brent Leas."
