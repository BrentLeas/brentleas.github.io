                <div class="collapsible-body white"><span>“I am very supportive of Brent Leas and his effort to get re-elected to the Bentonville School Board.  Brent is one of the finest Board members I have had the privilege of working with in my career.  He is always prepared, he is thoughtful, he understands school finance, and most importantly, he bases his decisions on the needs of children. During Brent’s tenure, some amazing accomplishments have taken place in Bentonville Schools.  Awards of performance at the local, state and national level are too numerous to name.  Several accomplishments that Brent and his fellow Board members should be honored for are having Bentonville named as the top school district in the State (NICHE), for improving the District’s graduation rate, for finding ways to deal with growth in a financially prudent way, and for building a top notch career tech program (Ignite).  I would be remiss if I did not state that Brent Leas really took the lead in helping develop Ignite.  He went on several trips to help better understand the model of delivery and helped encourage business leaders to collaborate on this new program. 
 <br>
 <br>
Finally, I would share that Brent Leas really understands what good governance looks like.  He does his homework prior to meetings, he asks questions prior to meetings as well at Board meetings, and he bases his decisions on what is best for students.  Bentonville School District would be fortunate to have Brent Leas for another term on the school board.  If I lived in that Board zone I would have zero reservations in supporting this leader.”

I have know Brent for many years and he is a God fearing man of great conviction and character.  When faced with conflict, he asks questions, listens and then strives to always make the best possible decisions for the students in the Bentonville School District.  Please Re-Elect Brent Leas to another term where he will continue to be a strong voice of positive leadership on the Bentonville School Board.”

      <div class="collapsible-body white"><span> Beyond a doubt, Brent Leas is the most qualified person to run for the school board position for the Bentonville Public Schools, Zone2. As a well-respected businessman & community leader, Brent has proven he can support the efforts of the school district to collaborate and bring other Civic/Business leaders to the table for healthy and robust discussions that effects change. Iam certain Brent will continue to build partnerships already forged in his current service, as already has been exemplified in his valued input in the creation of the Ignite Professional Studies program. He will be a constant advocate for both students and business patrons to create a balance between academics and business needs for our community. We need Brent and his commitment to continue - Building Educational Momentum - for our students and community. Vote for Brent Leas, Sept. 19th or early voting begins Sept. 12th.
