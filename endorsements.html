Brent is one of the finest Board members I have had the privilege of working with in my career.  He is always prepared, he is thoughtful, he understands school finance, and most importantly, he bases his decisions on the needs of children. During Brent’s tenure, some amazing accomplishments have taken place in Bentonville Schools.  Awards of performance at the local, state and national level are too numerous to name.  Several accomplishments that Brent and his fellow Board members should be honored for are having Bentonville named as the top school district in the State (NICHE), for improving the District’s graduation rate, for finding ways to deal with growth in a financially prudent way, and for building a top notch career tech program (Ignite).  I would be remiss if I did not state that Brent Leas really took the lead in helping develop Ignite.  He went on several trips to help better understand the model of delivery and helped encourage business leaders to collaborate on this new program. 
 <br>
 <br>
Finally, I would share that Brent Leas really understands what good governance looks like.  He does his homework prior to meetings, he asks questions prior to meetings as well at Board meetings, and he bases his decisions on what is best for students.  Bentonville School District would be fortunate to have Brent Leas for another term on the school board.  If I lived in that Board zone I would have zero reservations in supporting this leader.”</span>
