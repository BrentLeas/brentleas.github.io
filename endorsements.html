                <div class="collapsible-body white"><span>“I am very supportive of Brent Leas and his effort to get re-elected to the Bentonville School Board.  Brent is one of the finest Board members I have had the privilege of working with in my career.  He is always prepared, he is thoughtful, he understands school finance, and most importantly, he bases his decisions on the needs of children. During Brent’s tenure, some amazing accomplishments have taken place in Bentonville Schools.  Awards of performance at the local, state and national level are too numerous to name.  Several accomplishments that Brent and his fellow Board members should be honored for are having Bentonville named as the top school district in the State (NICHE), for improving the District’s graduation rate, for finding ways to deal with growth in a financially prudent way, and for building a top notch career tech program (Ignite).  I would be remiss if I did not state that Brent Leas really took the lead in helping develop Ignite.  He went on several trips to help better understand the model of delivery and helped encourage business leaders to collaborate on this new program. 
 <br>
 <br>
Finally, I would share that Brent Leas really understands what good governance looks like.  He does his homework prior to meetings, he asks questions prior to meetings as well at Board meetings, and he bases his decisions on what is best for students.  Bentonville School District would be fortunate to have Brent Leas for another term on the school board.  If I lived in that Board zone I would have zero reservations in supporting this leader.”

If this is the type of man you admire, then I recommend you vote for Brent."

      <div class="collapsible-body white"><span> "Beyond a doubt, Brent Leas is the most qualified person to run for the school board position for the Bentonville Public Schools, Zone2. As a well-respected businessman & community leader, Brent has proven he can support the efforts of the school district to collaborate and bring other Civic/Business leaders to the table for healthy and robust discussions that effects change. Iam certain Brent will continue to build partnerships already forged in his current service, as already has been exemplified in his valued input in the creation of the Ignite Professional Studies program. He will be a constant advocate for both students and business patrons to create a balance between academics and business needs for our community. We need Brent and his commitment to continue - Building Educational Momentum - for our students and community. Vote for Brent Leas, Sept. 19th or early voting begins Sept. 12th."

I have many friends who are active in the education of our precious young people. I recognize the need this community has right now for leaders who have the right vision and the right character to unite all of us into a mighty team for our children.
Brent Leas impressed Linda and I from the first time we met him all those years ago with his integrity of heart, his spirit of service, and his unflagging support for the public schools.
Education ought to be for the children, for the living, for the future. If you agree then you ought to be for my esteemed and wise friend, Mr Brent Leas.
If you have questions find me at the coffee house or the library, or the Facebook and lets talk about it."

                <div class="collapsible-body white"><span>“I have been honored to have served alongside Brent as a school board member during some of the most important decisions for the Bentonville School District over the last 5 years. 
Brent actively participated in numerous public forums to inform the community and the voters in Bella Vista of the overcrowding issue and how he would ensure that their tax dollars would be accounted for and spent wisely for their kids and families. He also diligently worked hard to ensure those voters that did not have school-aged children were represented equally in the process. Because of Brent’s efforts and his trustworthiness in representing the kids, parents and voters, Bella Vistans have shown strong support across the last two millage elections.
Brent understand the meaning of representation. He understands that being on the school board should be about providing the best education for the kids and families at the best value across the district. Brent represents all families and understands that different families have different needs. He is sensitive to different family situations, income levels, parent situations as well as Bentonville’s homeless student population. Brent understands that you elected him to make the best decisions on your behalf. He represents all the children and families regardless of income, status or influence. He understands that this role you have entrusted him with is to be earned everyday through hard work and consistency.
Brent is a servant leader. From working through thousands of hours over the last 5 years in developing the right millage structure for his voters to provide facilities for our overcrowded students to staying until 1:00 am working through issues in board meetings, Brent does what it takes to work hard and honor your trust in him.
Brent values children and families. He is very active dad not only with his three children but also with kids and families across the district. From his two BHS grads, Breanna and Josiah, to his daughter Sophia at Cooper Elementary, Brent understands the value of being present and active in the lives of students. When he makes decisions on the school board, he is always thinking about your kids, your family and his community.
Brent sacrifices for you. Being on the school board can be very fulfilling in service but it also requires great sacrifice. From the hours of meeting preparation, long committee and board meetings outside of his paying job to missed family time with his forgiving and loving wife, Stephanie, Brent and his family understand the cost for you.
Brent is a community leader. A good board member should be actively engaged throughout the community. Brent is actively involved in his church serving others across the community. His background in finance in working with individuals and business gives him great understanding into the challenges that the community faces. His service with the Benton County Rural Development Authority and Bentonville Rotary Club allows him the opportunity to serve others above himself.
Brent Leas has proven himself a strong, committed and trustworthy leader for your kids and families of the Bentonville School District and especially his neighbors in Bella Vista Zone 2! I highly recommend him to continue serving you and your kids and families for reelection!
