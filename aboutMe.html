       My wife Stephanie and I have been proud to have lived in Bella Vista, AR for the past 22 years. Our children -  Breanna ( K-12 - BHS Class of 2015), Josiah ( K-12 - BHS Class of 2017), and Sophia (Cooper Elementary incoming 4th grader) - have benefited from the excellent educational delivery of the Bentonville Public Schools

<br>
<br>
      As an engaged local bussinessman I strive to be known as a trusted and informed professional in the NWA community, so that I can share openly and help others achieve their fullest potential. I enjoy being fully engaged and giving back to our outstanding community.
	  <br>
      <br>
	  
	  Stephanie is a current Preschool teacher. She was also a former Bentonville Public Schools teachers aide and substitute. My wife and I have a passion to advocate for our Public School Teachers and Students. We strongly believe in our Bentonville Public Schools.
<br>
<br>
	   I have been humbled and blessed to have had the opportunity to serve for the past 5 years as the elected representative member on the Bentonville Public Schools Board of Education, Zone 2. I have been honored to have witnessed & been a part of the growth of our district over these past 5 years.
